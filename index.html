        <p id="head">How to Deal with Frizzy Hair</p>
        <p id="date">August 20, 2017</p>
        <p class="standard">Hey guys! It’s me Nathalee and I’m back at it again with a new blog entry! This entry will
            be all about FRIZZY hair and how to tame it especially during the hot and humid months. </p>
        <p class="subhead">But what exactly is frizzy hair and what causes it?</p>
        <p class="standard">Well, frizzy hair is basically just dry hair that’s parched. Because it’s dry, the hair
            cuticles appear opened and shaggy. So once it gets wet or exposed to humid air, it quickly soaks up the
            water and turns frizzy. People who have natural curls and waves usually have naturally frizzy hair but
            even those who have straight hair can deal with it too (like myself). So dry hair doesn’t even have to
            be because of you styling it every single day because you might actually just be born with it.
            For instance, I’m the type to leave my hair air dried and natural. I barely  use heat and I still deal
            with frizzy hair. So don’t be so hard on yourself, just embrace it!<br/><br/>

            Anyways, enough rambling. Let’s move on to my tips and tricks on how to tame our naturally dry and frizzy
            hair!</p>
        <p class="listing">1.	BE ALCOHOL-FREE!</p>
        <p class="standard">Many shampoos and conditioners out there are specifically labelled for dry and damaged
            hair but do they really work? If you read the list of ingredients on the back and come across an alcohol,
            don’t be fooled because you might just be setting up your hair for some major sabotage. Alcohol actually
            ruins your hair and there are many hair products out there that are “supposedly” designed for taming your
            frizzy hair, only making it worse by masking it further with an alcohol based solution.<br/>
            So if you want something safe, go for something that’s alcohol-free. My favourite shampoos are from Boo
            Bamboo and Dr. Bronner’s Castile Soap.</p>
        <div id="pic1" class="images"></div>
        <p class="listing">2.	 DO AN APPLE CIDER RINSE!</p>
        <p class="standard">Apple cider vinegar is a natural purifier as it removes all of the oil build up and dirt
            from your hair leaving it clean and fresh for the week. But not only does it keep your hair squeaky clean,
            it’s also a natural conditioner. Trust me, this will keep your hair super soft, silky and tamed from the
            frizz! I like to do rinses at least once a week.</p>
        <div id="pic2" class="images"></div>
        <p class="listing">3.	HAIR MASKS!</p>
        <p class="standard">Rehydrate your hair at least once a week to replenish your damaged hair. My tip is to
            always use something natural such as avocados, olive oil or coconut oil. I leave my hair masks on for at
            least 30 minutes and wash it off in the shower with my favourite shampoo. My personal favourite hair mask
            has got to be coconut oil ;) ! </p>
        <div id="pic3" class="images"></div>
        <p class="standard">For an organic and pure brand of coconut oil that's made specifically for beauty,
            this one by JASON has got to be my favourite!</p>
        <div id="pic4" class="images"></div>
        <p class="listing">4.	AFTER SHOWER HAIR OILS!</p>
        <p class="standard">Of course, it has to be the super natural kind, nothing that’s mixed with alcohol or man
            made oils. I usually put one dime sized drop in my hand and apply it all over my hair after I shower. Doing
            this helps keep my hair moisturized while it dries. I also put another drop in my hair after it’s dried
            especially since I have very thick and long hair. This keeps everything down and tamed as it adds that
            extra protection from the frizz. My favourite hair oil has got to be Pure Moroccan Argan Oil.</p>
        <div id="pic5" class="images"></div>
        <p class="listing">5.	GIVE YOUR HAIR A BREAK!</p>
        <p class="standard">I know I know. It’s really hard to take a break from your straightener or from that
            precious baby bliss curling iron for a few days. But if you really want your hair to go through a proper
            rehab from all that damage, you have to give it some time to heal and relax. Besides, nothing is sexier
            than you confidently rocking natural hair! So give your hair some love! Let loose! Go natural ;) But if
            your really don’t wanna show off those lovely locks or beautiful mermaid waves, you can always wear cute
            hair braids, inverted ponytails or even high/low buns! Be creative <3 </p>

            I hope you guys all enjoyed these fun little secrets to soft, silky smooth, and frizz free hair <3
            What do you do to tame your frizzy hair?<br/><br/>


            And remember, <span>GO NATURAL!</span><br/><br/><br/>
